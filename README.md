# flats_crawl
Crawler which goes through a website and fetches title, location, images, url of flat to the database. Subsequently crawler adds this information to the postgresql database. Also there is a simple http server, which displays flats with poor bootstrap styling. Anyway, you could go through all of this just by typing "docker-compose up" in cmd :)
